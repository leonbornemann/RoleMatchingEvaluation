# Role Matching Evaluation


Code Repository for the Submission "Role Matching in Temporal Data " to SIGMOD 2023. (Evaluation)

# Usage

The repository contains three python3 jupyter notebooks (https://jupyter.org/), that draw plots or print out the csv for tables in the paper. To execute the main evaluation, you need the files in the [localdata/](localData/) directory, as well as the sample drawn from the set of all pairs (available here)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/16J1yGQmjwUJu-k58x0DvIcRWy2r4OgsM/view].
